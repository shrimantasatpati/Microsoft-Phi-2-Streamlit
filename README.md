# Microsoft-Phi-2-Streamlit

Microsoft Phi 2 Streamlit App, deployed on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) is based on the Microsoft Phi 2 small language model (SLM) for text generation. Utilizing [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), this application enables users to effortlessly engage with Phi 2, generating text that is contextually rich in response to their prompts.
