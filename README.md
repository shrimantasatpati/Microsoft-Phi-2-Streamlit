# Microsoft-Phi-2-Streamlit

Microsoft Phi 2 Streamlit App, deployed on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) is based on the Microsoft Phi 2 small language model (SLM) for text generation. Utilizing [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), this application enables users to effortlessly engage with Phi 2, generating text that is contextually rich in response to their prompts.

##### Temperature - 0.9, max_new_tokens = 512
- It is a bit irrelevant in the output as temperature (parameter for creativity of prompt output).

##### Temperature - 0.1, max_new_tokens = 512
- Correct output but some unwanted tokens leakage in the prompt output.
